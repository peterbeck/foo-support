foo-support
===========

foo.li remote support (gitso modified)

nothing fancy, just gitso sources but modified with foo.li icons, links etc 
and replaced tightvnc win32 with newer edition.

original sources for gitso:
http://code.google.com/p/gitso/


modifications (so far...):
* changed icons (foo.li), installer files/names
* netstat.cmd /sed.exe included (german windows xp)
* replaced tighvnc with version 2.7 (no disconnect on UAC dialog)
* if windows > XP, UAC dialogs will be disabled while Gitso is running
  (when running Gitso as Administrator, no issues with UAC anymore!)
* 7Zip-Batch and SFX-Config for non-install version
